# Packet-Tracer-Courses
This repository is mainly for storing and showing my progress with learning Packet Tracer

This repository is from Jeremy's IT Lab Courses. Networking is my Achilles' heel so I want to improve on it, by doing thses labs it will hopefully make me more familiar with the subject.
